# PASSOWRD VAULT

I recently made a transition into the cybersecurity space and with that said, I decided to start building projects that can help individuals and organizations alike be more secure! 👨🏾‍💻
</br></br>
I have built a password cracker, a keylogger. This project is a Command-Line based Password Vault to store passowrds for different applications, so that users do not have to remember so much and can be rest assured that their password is secure.

## Technologies Used

-   Node.Js
-   TypeScript
-   FS(File System)
-   Crypto Hasing Module
-   Readline Interface - to get data from the standard input of the user.

### CTA

I am on the hunt for junior information security roles where I can gain hands-on experience. I believe my background in backend development makes me very competent for this transition!
